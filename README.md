##  My First Script —— Automatic video scrolling

Automatic video scrolling script under /python/ai-video/main.py

**Instructions**

* It refers to the pyautogui module, so you must install this module before using it

* Install and use scrcpy, which is not described here. Open the short video software.

* When using, you must first maximize the height of the window and the width of the window to the appropriate position to maximize the screen projection of the mobile phone, and finally move the window to the rightmost end. Because this script works on the principle of controlling mouse movement.

* When everything above is ready, run the script and use it.
